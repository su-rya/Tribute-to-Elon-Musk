      <h3 class="Aim3">"To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels."</h3>
      <p class="About3">The Boring Company (also known as TBC) is an American infrastructure and tunnel construction services company founded by Elon Musk in
        December 2016.Musk has cited difficulty with Los Angeles traffic and limitations with the current two-dimensional transportation
        network as inspiration for the project.</p>
      <p class="Goal">"Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight and won't fall on your head. A large network of tunnels many levels
        deep would help alleviate congestion in any city, no matter how large it grew (just keep adding levels).
        The key to making this work is increasing tunneling speed and dropping costs by a factor of
        10 or more â€“ this is the goal of The Boring Company"</p>
